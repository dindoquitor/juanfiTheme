This is my own customize juanfi portal with movies

## Overview

The "juanfiTheme" project is a customized web portal focused on movies. It is a personal project where the developer has tailored a portal to suit their preferences and interests, particularly in movies.

## Key Components

1. **HTML Files:**

   - The project contains several HTML files within the "hotspot" directory, each representing different web pages. These pages include:
     - `movies.html`: Likely the main page for displaying movies.
     - `pmovies.html`: Possibly a page for Pinoy (Filipino) movies.
     - `tvshows.html`: A page dedicated to TV shows.
     - Other pages like `login.html`, `logout.html`, `status.html`, etc., which might handle user authentication and status.

2. **JavaScript Functionality:**

   - The JavaScript code, such as in `core.js`, is used to add interactivity and functionality to the web pages. For example, the `fetchData` function in `movies.html` fetches movie data from an external API (The Movie Database API) and updates the movie list on the page.
   - Functions like `populatePromoRates` in `core.js` suggest that the portal might also include features related to promotional rates, possibly for internet or data services.

3. **Styling:**

   - The project uses CSS for styling, as seen in the inline styles within the HTML files. The styles define the layout and appearance of elements like movie containers, buttons, and text.

4. **Assets:**

   - The "assets" directory contains resources such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files, which are used to enhance the visual and functional aspects of the portal.

5. **Data Handling:**
   - The "data" directory contains text files that might store additional data or configuration information for the project.

## Functionality

- **Movie Display:** The portal fetches and displays movies using an external API. Users can browse through movies, view details, and possibly watch trailers or full movies.
- **Navigation:** The presence of multiple HTML files suggests that users can navigate between different sections, such as movies, TV shows, and possibly user account management.
- **Customization:** The project is customized to the developer's preferences, which might include specific styling, layout, and features unique to their vision of a movie portal.

## Conclusion

Overall, the "juanfiTheme" project is a web-based movie portal with customized features and styling. It leverages external APIs to fetch movie data and provides a user interface for browsing and interacting with movie content. The project is structured to include various web pages, assets, and data handling components, making it a comprehensive personal project focused on movies.
